# Research problem: can we predict people's fav program type according to self-reported demographic info?

## Research method, decision tree with rpart

### intepretation and conclusion: the tree is outperforming random guessing and guessing the most frequent option. However, it is still not quite accurate. Moreover, since this classification task has obvious unequal consequences depending on false positives/negatives, I don't inteprete them differently.

     )

added_membership_duration <- added_dates_data |>
